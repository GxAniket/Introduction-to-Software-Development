What is Encapsulation in Java?

Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Controlled Access
It means binding data (variables) and methods (functions) together inside a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to data.

Variables → private (hidden from outside world)

Methods → public getters/setters (controlled access)



Key Points

Private variables = secure, can’t be accessed directly outside class.

Public methods = provide controlled access (getters/setters).

Helps in data hiding & better security.

Real-life example → ATM Machine: We press buttons (methods) but don’t see internal code (data).



Why Encapsulation is Important

Data security → variables are hidden

Code flexibility → easy to change code later

Validation → can validate data before setting it
